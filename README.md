<p>This is RenalBot. The worlds most sophisticated tool to make fun of Filip. With this bot there is also a help command just in case you’re feeling a bit lost. Also there’s about two features.<br>

Takes the message and turns it into a query that can be searched on Wikipedia. Returning the first however much amount of text that we want to send to the user. <em>Might want to find a way to insure that the information provided is always relevant</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add Server Creation date as a command</p>
<ul>
<li>Probably add other commands that could also be useful for interesting things about the server and the people on it. Such as:
<ul>
<li>Account Creation</li>
<li>Every message they’ve sent? (Maybe. Don’t want my computer to explode)</li>
<li>Do something with their presences?</li>
<li>Roles? What would I do with that?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dog command<br>
Because apparently you wanted a Dog command</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bird Command<br>
If you get a Dog command than I want a bird one</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Voice channel Shenanigans</p>
<ul>
<li>InspiroBot Mindless mode</li>
<li>MF Google Assistant. I’m gonna get the god damn thing working.<br>
Might Kill me but it’s going to work.</li>
<li>Might decide to make an actually good Music bot or just recycle code and make it so-so.</li>
</ul>
